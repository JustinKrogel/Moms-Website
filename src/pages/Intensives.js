			Why spend weeks and months working through an emotional issue, when you could find resolution and relief in a matter of hours condensed into a couple of weeks? The traditional therapy format with Dr. Krogel and other therapists involves individuals attending 1 hour sessions every one to two weeks over a mater of weeks and months. Some individuals looking for more immediate relief or with constraints due to work schedules or driving distance may request to schedule Intensive sessions that last multiple hours and/or multiple days in a week. In this format months worth of therapy can be accomplish in a very short amount of time. This ability to condense the therapeutic work into a short amount of time is a special property of the EMDR Therapy that is not possible with most other psychotherapy approaches.
